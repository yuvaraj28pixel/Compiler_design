# Compiler_design
A Project on compiler design where we made a custom programming language compiler using lex, yacc and python.

Project has the following phases:
1) Lexical analysis
2) syntax analysis
3) Intermediate Code Generation
4) Code Optimization

  - Common Subexpression Elimination
  - Constant Folding and Propagation

Note: 
Run the build.sh file in terminal to execute the code in each folder.

To give permission to run build.sh file:

chmod +x build.sh

To execute:

./build.sh
